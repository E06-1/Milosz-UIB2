    <h2 id="Junior">Junior Boys - Over it</h2>
    [Verse 1] <br />
    Baby baby <br />
    Hope is for the middle of the night <br />
    But hope is fading <br />
    With the first sign of the city light <br />
    And I'm staying with it baby <br />
    Keeping out of sight <br />
    And I'm praying for us baby <br />
    Put your little fire out at night yeah <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Verse 2] <br />
    Sures and maybes <br />
    Better than a quick alright <br />
    Cause you're passing crazies <br />
    And you're feeling like you're living in a street fight <br />
    And we're bound to fall apart <br />
    Before it even starts <br />
    After everything I've read <br />
    It's better if you have a single bed <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus] <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Verse 3] <br />
    Baby baby <br />
    Seeing you would be too much <br />
    I got so crazy <br />
    Found a new place to forget your touch <br />
    And I'm digging up the earth <br />
    Now that I'm feeling sure <br />
    I lost that to the dirt <br />
    It won't be felt it won't be felt it won't be felt <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus] <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Bridge] <br />
    So come on back down town my love <br />
    It's better when you're around my love, no <br />
    Come on now <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus] <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    (Don't hurt me, don't hurt me) <br />
    The night is gone but you're afraid to go home <br />
    (But don't hurt me) <br />
    But you're afraid to go home <br />
    But you're afraid to go home <br />
    (I'm over it) <br />
    But you're afraid to go home <br />

    <h2 id="Massive">Massive Attack - Unfinished Sympathy</h2>
    [Verse 1: Shara Nelson] <br />
    I know that I've imagined love before <br />
    And how it could be with you <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus: Shara Nelson] <br />
    Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby <br />
    How can you have a day without a night? <br />
    You're the book that I have opened <br />
    And now I've got to know much more <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Verse 2: Shara Nelson] <br />
    The curiousness of your potential kiss <br />
    Has got my mind and body aching <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus: Shara Nelson] <br />
    Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby <br />
    How can you have a day without a night? <br />
    You're the book that I have opened <br />
    And now I've got to know much more <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Verse 3: Shara Nelson] <br />
    Like a soul without a mind <br />
    In a body without a heart <br />
    I'm missing every part <br />
    Like a soul without a mind <br />
    In a body without a heart <br />
    I'm missing every part <br />
    Like a soul without a mind <br />
    In a body without a heart <br />
    I'm missing every part <br />
    Like a soul without a mind <br />
    In a body without a heart <br />
    I'm missing every part <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Outro: ?] <br />
    I don't know where this one came from <br />
    I don't know where this one came from <br />
    I don't know where this, I don't know where this <br />
    I don't know where this, I don't know where this <br />
    I don't know where this one came from <br />

    [Verse 2: Travis Scott] <br />
    Jacques turned La Flame, now he rolling on an Addy <br />
    Fifty on a chain, 'nother fifty on a Caddy, oh <br />
    He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone <br />
    Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley <br />
    Hmm, yeah, to find that alley, mm <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Chorus: Kacy Hill] <br />
    Baby's hooked on feeling low <br />
    Do, do, do <br />
    Do, doo <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    [Bridge: Travis Scott & Kacy Hill] <br />

    In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh <br />
    It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley <br />
    Baby's hooked on feeling low <br />
    In the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley <br />

    [Verse 3: Travis Scott] <br />
    Yeah <br />

    I'm falling in and out of clouds, don't worry, I'ma get it, Granny, uh
    <br />
    What happened? Now my daddy happy <br />
    Mama called me up, that money coming and she love me <br />
    I done made it now, I done found life's meaning now <br />
    All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now <br />
    Friends turning into fraud niggas <br />
    Practicing half the passion, you niggas packaged different <br />
    All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it <br />
    I'ma sell it, you niggas salad, we 'bout the cabbage <br />
    Youngest nigga out of Houston at the Grammys <br />
    Smiling at 'em laughing at me <br />
    I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked then passed it back, bitch <br />
    All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin, yeah, yeah <br />
    Mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know <br />
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know <br />
    Cuzzo said we in the stu', yeah, we 'bout to drop a four <br />
    He passed the cigarette, I choke, woo <br />

    Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down <br />
    I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now <br />
    Whole crew, I swear they counting on me <br />
    Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me <br />
    Houses on me, he got them ounces on him <br />
    Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em <br />
    Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses <br />
    I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them <br />
    Distant sky, from north of the border, my chips is in order <br />
    My mom's biggest supporter so now a nigga support a nigga <br />
